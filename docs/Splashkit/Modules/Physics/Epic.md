# Physics Epic

TBA

## Background / Context
Splashkit is a live product, which can be improved as per valid suggestions and observations. 
Currently recognised area of improvement is physics.

## Business Value
Trying and making a product better even if its live and functioning will always keep splashkit in use and 
demand throughout all its users irrespective of any future competitions.

## In Scope
Splashkit Core SDK
SplashKit.io

## Out of Scope
SplashKit Translator and SKM

## What needs to happen:
Realistic physics -
Adding behaviour that make sprite and object interactions more realistic (through collisions, gravity, 
synching objects, projectile motion) by adding C++ functions into existing header files to create one-line 
functions which execute the relevant physics motion.

## Assumptions / Dependencies
Previous contribution code is accessible and working.
Everything is customisable by the user (ie, for visual data, they can choose colour, etc, for presentation)
Previous data to make it visibl

## UX/UI Considerations
N/A

## Analytics Considerations
None Known

## Regulation & Compliance Considerations
N/A

## Operations / Support / Training Considerations
Team members will need to become familiar with SplashKit, C++, potentially Ninja and CMake
Advise teams 2 weeks in advance of planned release
Current supportive documentation exists (explaining creation procedures, etc).


## Acceptance criteria
Successful addition of realistic physics.
Functional (passes QA)
Easy to use (user acceptance testing completed)
Design decisions and work documented.
Documentation fits current expectations set by SplashKit.io and stakeholder
