# Machine Learning Epic

## Background / Context

SplashKit is a live product, which can be improved as per valid suggestions and observations. The
addition of machine learning is one of the recognised areas for improvement.

## Business Value

The addition of machine learning enables game developers to develop more interactive and enjoyable
games, where a game player can then co-operate or compete against an AI character.

## In Scope

- SplashKit Core SDK (program code for the feature)
- SplashKit.io (articles on usage of the feature)

## Out of Scope

- SplashKit Translator
- SKM

## What needs to happen

- Extend the existing code so that the reinforcement learning agent can be applied to a variety of
  user games
- Create artificial neural networks in SplashKit so that a wider variety of reinforcement learning
  techniques can be implemented
- Produce documentation for the usage of the module
- Assess the potential for integration with the data analytics module

## Assumptions / Dependencies

- Previous contribution code is accessible and working

## UX/UI Considerations

N/A

## Analytics Considerations

None known

## Regulation & Compliance Considerations

N/A

## Operations / Support / Training Considerations

- Team members must become familiar with SplashKit, C++, Ninja and CMake
- Upskilling may be needed if team members do not have prior knowledge of reinforcement learning and
  artificial neural networks
- Advise teams 2 weeks in advance of planned release

## Acceptance criteria

- Successful addition of machine learning into SplashKit with the capability of adding an AI agent
  to a variety of user games
- Functional and passing QA
- Easy to use (user acceptance testing completed)
- Documentation completed for design decisions and work
- Documentation fits current expectations as set by SplashKit.io and stakeholders
