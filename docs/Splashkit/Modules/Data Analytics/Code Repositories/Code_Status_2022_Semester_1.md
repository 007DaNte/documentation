Despite bug fixes

## Issues To Be Resolved

- Review on whether string recognition is required.
  - If yes, create dynamic objects for each item to be recognised
    - Regex also needs to be fixed
    - Actioning this is not urgent, but course of action is
  - If no, remove altogether, along with tests
- Clean up Dataframes code line by line
  - Superfluous code present, needs to be simplified
  - Research Pandas Dataframes and review our current setup
  - Add basic functions required for simple implementation
- Create new display function
  - Needs to work on all systems
- Test Dataframe code
  - As we don't think it has ever compiled or run, we need to determine that all functions and objects work properly.
    - If they don't, either refactor or begin to re-write code based on [Scope documents](../Scope/Index.md).
  - Tests will have to be created as none currently exist for the dataframes.
