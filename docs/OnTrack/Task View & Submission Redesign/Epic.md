# View Task and Submission Epic
## Background / Context
OnTrack is employed by multiple institutions as a learning management system. The View Task and Submission project intends to create modern, user-centric modifications to the OnTrack platform. OnTrack requires the modification of existing features, addition of new features, and an overhaul of the UI/UX.

## Business Value
By further modernising OnTrack, institutions can deploy the OnTrack platform to satisfy the needs of their students, markers, assessors, and auditors. The platform can support all stakeholders to fulfil their obligations and, in the case of the student, support the learning of essential concepts.

## In Scope
- Design planning and documentation
- Removal of redundant features
- Modification of existing features
- Addition of new features
- Task view for students
- Task submission for students
- Task view for markers
- Front-end
- Back-end
- Security
- Database

## Out of Scope
- Visual flavour
- Logo

## What Must Happen
- Organise a meeting with a managing director, the OnTrack area lead, and project team to ensure requirements are communicated first-hand.
- Create user stories derived from several stakeholder personas.
- Four high-fidelity wireframes must be created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
    - Of these, two must be selected by a managing director and the OnTrack area lead.
- Two high-fidelity wireframes must be further refined, working on interation-based feedback and incorporating OnTrack's visual style.
    - Of these, one must be selected by the managing director and the OnTrack area lead.
- A prototype must be created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
    - The prototype must have click-through capabilities.
- A document must be created that contains the current interface the back-end provides the front-end.
- A proof of concept must be created for the back-end.

## Assumptions / Dependencies
- All additional functions and features can work when implemented to the student and assessor views.
- Deployment can't create any additional security risks.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Navigability
    - Can all features be navigated to?
        - New features?
        - Previous features that were retained?
        - A prototype must be created with click-through capabilities.
- Accessibility

## Regulation & Compliance Considerations
- Storage and privacy of user's data.
- Security
- Retention policy.

## Operations / Support / Training Considerations
Team members may require training/up-skilling in applications, technologies, and languages, such as:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/),
- [Figma](https://figma.com/),
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/),
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/),
- [Python](https://www.python.org/),
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
- [Angular](https://angular.io/),
- etc.

Team members must express testing skills by use of various testing tools to ensure functionalities work as intended. They also must be able to fix and/or document and report on issues or bugs as they arise.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Managing director must approve of the design that is followed through with.
- Implementation must follow design.
    - If a change is required, then an alteration to the design (with approval from the managing director) must be completed first.
- All code must be tested.
