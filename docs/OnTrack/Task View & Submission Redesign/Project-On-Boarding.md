## What Next?
- Become familiar with [the project epic](Epic.md)
- Become familiar with [the user stories and features](User-Stories-and-Features.md)
    - Are there any users that are not served in the user stories or by the features?
- Become familiar with [the requirements](Requirements.md)
    - Are all stakeholders sufficiently provided for, with this set of requirements?
- Examine [Grady's proposed design](Wireframe%20Iteration%20designs/Iteration%203%20Design%201%20by%20Grady%20Ramsay.png) and ensure all requirements are met, and that the inclusion of the features are user-friendly.
- Examine [Ricky's proposed design](Wireframe%20Iteration%20designs/Iteration-3-Design-2-by-Ricky-Dodd.png) and ensure all requirements are met, and that the inclusion of the features are user-friendly.
    - Examine [Ricky's prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/XmKxWQ43MwrD6Red1DvYq6/Wire-Frame-Designs?node-id=478%3A4466&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=476%3A4327&starting-point-node-id=478%3A4466).
- Select a front-end design to modify, improve, extend, or implement.
- Examine Matt's back-end emulator.
    - Has it successfully passed proof-of-concept?
    - How can git be implemented on the back-end of the OnTrack product?
- Work on implementing the front-end and back-end.
- If somebody on your team is well-versed in cyber-security, then an examination of the security of the implementation is required.
- If somebody on the team is well-versed in databases and database administration, then a model of the database is required.

## Helpful Points
- If you are using Windows as your primary operating system and you have not downloaded, installed, and/or set-up MinGW, then a former team found the Linux subsystem [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) as a helpful development environment.
