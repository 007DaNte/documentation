## **QA Deliverables**

What artifacts will QA will provide to the team (eg, Test Strategy, Sample Test Plan, Bug reports)

- Test Strategy
- Feature Template
- Automation Guide
- Test Case Template
- Use Cases

## **Test Management**

What resources are used to carry out testing in terms of tooling, environments, supported platforms
and versions, and test data.

- Selenium Webdriver.io (WDIO)
- Chromedriver
- Docker is used to set up Ontrack Locally (if required)
- Test Runs TBD

### **Examples**

- Jenkins is used to build test versions of the application off of master and PRs
- VMs are used to test the applications in Windows
- Test runs are input in Testpad to make it clear what scenarios were tested and if those scenarios
  pass or fail
- Supported operating systems are Windows 7 and 10 and Mac
- Test data will include user accounts

## **Scope of Testing**

What types of tests exist for this project?

- There are existing unit test written in minitest by back end devs
- No current UI or manual testing exists

## **Potential Enhancements**

Git hub actions:

- This seems to be avaliable to use with WDIO more infor can be found here:
  https://webdriver.io/docs/githubactions/

Test case management systems:

- As no current test cases have been created we need to decide on if we implement a manual markdown
  statergy or look to use an external application to help store and manage test runs. Examples:

Testiny: https://www.testiny.io/#pricing (Unlimited users for opensource projects)

Tarantula: http://www.tarantula.fi/old/?r=qal-ostmt (open source, but uneeded execution
features,also bulky UI/UX with logins)
