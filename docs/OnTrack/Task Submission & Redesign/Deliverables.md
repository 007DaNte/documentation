# Project Deliverables
## Purpose of this Document
This document outlines the deliverables the Task View and Submission Redesign project intends to deliver upon. Each trimester, this document is to be reassessed.

## Structure of the Deliverables
The deliverables are grouped into long-term and short-term deliverables. Both of these groups are further grouped into role-specific groups, where documentation is an outlier (all team members are to complete documentation).

All deliverables have the common form:
```
- [ ] What needs to be done.
    - What evidence needs to be produced to show this is completed or on-going. 
```

These deliverables should then be decomposed into constituting tasks, mediated by some collaborative technology (for example, [Trello](https://trello.com/)).
