# Project Deliverables

## Purpose of this Document

This document outlines the deliverable items the Task View and Submission Redesign project intends
to deliver upon. Each trimester, this document is to be reassessed. All team members are expected to
express their expertise by breaking down deliverable items into smaller, actionable tasks on a
collaborative technology such as Trello.

## Structure of the Deliverables

All deliverable items are grouped into roles, but team members are allowed (and encouraged) to
operate outside of their selected roles.

All deliverable items have the common form:

```
- [ ] What needs to be done.
    - What evidence needs to be produced to show this is completed or on-going.
```

These deliverable items should then be decomposed into constituting tasks, mediated by some
collaborative technology (for example, [Trello](https://trello.com/)).
