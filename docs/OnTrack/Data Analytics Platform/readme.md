# Data analytics platform - Something we can use to help better expose data on student and tutor progress to staff

We want to make sure that the data stay within our control, so nothing should be sent to external
services, but if there are other tools we can deploy onsite then we should look at that and how they
get integrated back into the UI.

Tracking time spent giving feedback by tutor would be a great single addition if someone wants to
work on that. This would have some design work, back-end work, front-end work and data analytics.
