of our team.

This report is for stakeholders, investors, and employees, and will outline the
company structure, charter, objectives – both short and long term, and explore
each product’s goals in depth.

Within the first third of 2022, Thoth Tech has recruited approximately 92 employees
including four area leads, three product leads and eleven delivery leads.

The second third of 2022 has seen Thoth Tech grow to approximately 104 employees,
including five product leads and sixteen delivery leads.

There will be another recruitment phase during the last third of the year, with the
potential for internships throughout the company.

Along with recruitment, Thoth Tech has taken onboard three external products, two
live and well-established products – OnTrack and SplashKit – and DreamBig, a in
development product which will leverage the OnTrack technology stack. Thoth Tech
will also be creating our internal architecture and platform for employees throughout
this third of the year, referred to as the Internal System project.

Both the OnTrack and SplashKit products have been identified as requiring extensions
and additional features to improve the quality and usability of the product. OnTrack
is a platform designed to facilitate student learning and reducing the pressure of
achieving unrealistic grades. The focus is on providing a tailored learning experience,
using tasks and a portfolio assessment. This product is live and is currently being
upgraded to newer technology stacks and improving security and documentation. SplashKit
is currently a 2D game development Software Development Kit used to teach object-oriented
coding to beginners. It has been identified that SplashKit can be expanded to explore
other areas and languages. The DreamBig product is in response to a need identified
by Deakin,to provide a personalised development roadmaps to enhance students’ employability.
Due to a partnership with the School of IT at Deakin University, Thoth Tech and
the subsequent products are funded, supported, and leveraged by Deakin. However,
all contributions by Thoth Tech members are acknowledged due to the Open-Source
nature of the company. Deakin provides ground zero end-user testing and focus groups
for product improvements.

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester, the arcade machine team has a solid foundation to build on, given
the creation of a Windows application capable of cloning the games repository,
and executing the games on a playable interface. The work of last trimester allows
the team of this trimester to take closer steps to creating a physical arcade machine.
The machine will perform similarly to a Multi-Game Arcade Machine, allowing users
to select a game from a local library of games. Objectives include:  
  • Software which:
    o Is cross platform compatible
    o
  • The development of:
    o
    o Documentation

Additional features which may be considered later in the lifecycle of the project include the development and deployment of a website which:
